datasets are obtained from https://zenodo.org/records/8011697, since the dataset is relatively large, we only provided the most necessary data and processing codes. You can obtain the whole dataset from zonedo.

We also provided the preprocessed data for epidermis, and the datasets and checkpoints have been uploaded to google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yxt_4WNrK1WslvzFs05qll7djcGzKPYO .
